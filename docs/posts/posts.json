So I am giving this a go. When blogs became popular among my peers in college I started one and actually kept it up for a few years. Out of curiosity I recently googled my old blogspot space and itâ€™s still online. It was so funny to see the random things I wrote at such a young age, and what I liked about it most was that it was fun and lighthearted which is what I hope to bring to this new space. If anyone actually reads this, welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
