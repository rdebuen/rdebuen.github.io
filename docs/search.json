While I am focused on environmental issues, I am most interested in their intersection with human well-being, equity, and health. I have worked on projects across many areas including urban mobility, water policy, ocean governance, corporate sustainability, and climate policy. I also have extensive international experience having grown up in Mexico and lived in the United States, Spain, and the UK. I find almost everything interesting and I am always trying to learn new things and develop skills through which to analyze and solve problems. I am good at building relationships within the workplace and with clients and stakeholders. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow for Ocean Nexus at UW Earthlab focusing on bringing an equity lens to applied policy analysis for ocean governance.\r\n            My recent academic research focused on non-motorized mobility, where I explored questions of civil society led advocacy, policy adoption, institutionalization, implementation, and effectiveness. My work draws from various disciplines including public policy, geography, public health, engineering, urban planning, and public management. I also use a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods which leverage diverse data sources including open source and crowdsourced transportation data on infrastructure and travel, administrative data, policy documents, and interview data.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Selected publications and features\r\n            de Buen Kalman, R.
