#Bio
I am a PhD student in Public Policy and Management at the University of Washington in Seattle. My academic interests center on policy and governance of active transportation, and I am generally interested in the relationship between urban environments, social justice, health and human well-being. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a policy analyst for the Latin America Regional Climate Initiative (now Iniciativa Climatica de Mexico) and the Mario Molina Center. I also worked for the Climate Change and Sustainability department at KPMG Madrid as a corporate social responsibility analyst.

#Education
I hold a Bachelors of Science from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Mexico, an Msc in Water Science, Policy and Management from Oxford University and an Msc in Public Policy from the University of Washington.
